##Project 1: Employee Directory

This is one of the projects present in the course about building applications using Meteor and React at Udemy by Stephen Grider.

###Project Overview

In this app, the user should see a list of employees. Each employee is displayed as a single card which has the user's avatar, name, email and phone number on it.

The employee data is generated by using the `faker` library and stored using `MongoDB` thus may contain up to thousands of employees. 

Considering this huge amount of data present, the user should only be able to see 10-20 employees on the first page load and should be able to load more employees using a button.
